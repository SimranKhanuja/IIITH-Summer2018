#Descriptions of Tasks
 
Task 1 : Tokenization is the process of identification of tokens. Example: 'On Tuesday, however, the pacers found their calling.', can be tokenized as 'On Tuesday , however , the pacers found their calling .', where ',' and '.' are identified as tokens along with the words. SMS data is always hard to tokenize as people tend to write words without giving spaces. The dataset given for this task is an xml file. First task is to extract the message, and then tokenize. Create your own tokenizer, creating tokenization requires identification of patterns which can be achieved through regular expressions. See where you are finding trouble. Use custom tokenizers available in nltk, if you have not installed install this package (python nltk package) as the next task.
